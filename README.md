## An educational Discord Login Phishing Tool
Credit to https://github.com/snimmagadda1/discord-login-clone for most of the the React Discord login creation.

This is a very basic yet powerful phishing website that is connected to a Google Firebase database. Once the user logs in, it will redirect 
to one of Discord's authentication pages to ensure credibility. Please use this with caution as stealing people's passwords is a crime.
